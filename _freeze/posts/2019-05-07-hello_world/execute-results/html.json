This website was developed with R Markdown, Blogdown, Hugo, and served via Netlify. I tried hosting this on GitHub Pages, but had difficulty with Jekyll and the R Markdown format. Having read about Blogdown, I'm making the transition.\n\nSo far this is great. I can embed R code like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOr include plots:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npie(\n  c(280, 60, 20),\n  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),\n  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),\n  init.angle = -50, border = NA\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2019-05-07-hello_world_files/figure-html/sky-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n\nI don't anticipate blogging a lot, but I hope to make this a platform to showcase some of my pet projects. Fair warning, a lot of my projects revolve on my dog, Harper, so I literally mean \"pet\". Below are a few examples I hope to post about soon:\n\n* Raspberry Pi timelapse video of Harper crate-training\n* Harper/Not Harper image classification mobile app\n* Harper autoencoder to generate new, \"fake\" Harper images\n\n---\n\n![Thanks for reading!](/img/harper.jpg){width=100% height=100%}\n\n",
